This plugin will generate a font pairing preview of selected font families available in the Google Web Fonts directory.

== Description ==

The Font Pairing Preview plugin allows you to specify and experiment with any of the font families available in the Google Web Fonts directory.

Simply enter one font family name for the heading and another for the body and click a button to see an instant font pairing preview.

You can also specify font size and line height.

NOTE: This plugin currently caters for the 500+ font families which can be found in the Google Web Font directory.

After installing and activating the Font Pairing Preview plugin, you can start to experiment with your font pairings by going to the following menu item: 
Settings->Foint Pairing Preview 

From the Font Pairing Preview menu mentioned above you will be taken to the plugin's page.

To use the plugin simply enter the required font details such as:
Font Family For Heading Text

Font Size for Heading Text (optional - defaults to 70px)

Line Height For Heading Text (optional - defaults to 90px)

Font Family For Body Text

Font Size for Body Text (optional - defaults to 15px)

Line Height For Body Text (optional - defaults to 25px)


The plugin has a handy auto-complete capability as you start typing the font family names. 
This makes it easy for you to choose an appropriate Google font type without having to look it up or remember how to spell it.
